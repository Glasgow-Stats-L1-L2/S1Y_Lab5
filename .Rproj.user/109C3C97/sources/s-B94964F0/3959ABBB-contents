# How does the proportion affect the margin of error? {-}

Imagine you've set out to survey 1000 people on two questions:

- Are you at least 6-feet tall?

- Are you left-handed?

Since both of these sample proportions were  calculated from the same sample size, they should have the same margin of error, right? *Wrong!* While the margin of error does change with sample size, it is also affected by the proportion $p$.

Think back to the formula for the standard error, also seen on <a href="https://www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=os4_tablet&referrer=/stat/os4.php#page=172" target="_blank">OpenIntro Page 172</a>: $SE = \sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$. This is then used in the formula for the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval:
$$ ME = 1.96\times SE = 1.96\times\sqrt{p(1-p)/n} \,. $$
Since the population proportion $p$ is in this $ME$ formula, it should make sense that the margin of error is in some way dependent on the population proportion. We can visualise this relationship between $p$ and $ME$ by creating a plot of $ME$ (on the y-axis) vs. $p$ (on the x-axis).

Since sample size is irrelevant to this discussion, let's just set it to some arbitrary value ($n = 1000$) and use this value in the following calculations:

```{r n-for-me-plot, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
n <- 1000
```

The first step is to create a variable `p` that can take any value between 0 and 1. We use the `seq()` function to create a sequence of possible values for $p$ from 0 to 1 with each number incremented by 0.01. This is simply to create a set of values that we will eventually plot on the x-axis. You can then create a variable for the margin of error (`ME`) associated with each of these values of `p` using the familiar approximate formula ($ME = 2 \times SE$). `

```{r p-me, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
p <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01)
me <- 2 * sqrt(p * (1 - p)/n)
```

Lastly, you can plot the two variables, (the proportion `p` and the margin or error `me`), against each other to reveal their relationship.

```{r me-plot, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, fig.align="center"}
dd <- data.frame(p = p, me = me)

ggplot(data = dd, aes(x = p, y = me)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Population Proportion", y = "Margin of Error")
```

```{r MCQ4}
opts_Q4 <- sample(c(answer = "p and ME have a quadratic or parabolic relationship.",
                    "They have a linear relationship.",
                    "They have an inverse cubic relationship.",
                    "p and ME do not appear to be related."))
```

<br>

**How would you describe the relationship between `p` and `ME`?**
`r longmcq(opts_Q4)`

`r hide("Hint")`
What type of graph that you will have seen in Maths at school does this remind you of?
`r unhide()`

```{r MCQ5}
opts_Q5 <- sample(c("If we were to increase the sample size n, the margin of error would decrease.",
                    "If we lower our confidence value, say from 95% to 90%, the the margin of error would decrease.",
                    "You can work out exactly for which value of p the margin of error is maximised mathematically using differentiation.",
                    answer = "Changing the value of n would make no difference to the graph."))
```

<br>

**Select the INCORRECT statement:**
`r longmcq(opts_Q5)`

`r hide("Hint")`
Try changing the value of `n` in the code above and notice what difference (if any) this makes to the values on the y-axis.
`r unhide()`

<!-- Is this the relationship you expected based on the formula $ME = 1.96\times\sqrt{p(1-p)/n} \,$ ? -->

```{r MCQ6}
opts_Q6 <- sample(c("ME is maximised when p = 0.33, or a third.",
                    "ME is maximised when p = 0",
                    "ME is maximised when p = 1",
                    answer = "ME is maximised when p = 0.5"))
```

<br>

**For a given sample size, for which value of $p$ is the margin of error ($ME$) maximized?**
`r longmcq(opts_Q6)`

`r hide("Hint")`
Look carefully at the value on the x axis that gives the largest value on the y axis.
`r unhide()`
