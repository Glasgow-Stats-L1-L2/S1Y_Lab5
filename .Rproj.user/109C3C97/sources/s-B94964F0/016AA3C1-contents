# Inference on Proportions {-}

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention seeks to report the proportion of people who have texted while driving each day for the past 30 days.

To do this, you can answer the question, "What proportion of people in your sample reported that they have texted while  driving each day for the past 30 days?" with a **sample statistic**; while the question "What proportion of people in the general population have texted while driving each day for the past 30 days?" is answered with an **estimate of the population parameter**.

The inferential tools for estimating population proportions are: confidence intervals and the hypothesis tests.

### Calculating Confidence Intervals (CIs) for proportions {-}

Recall <a href="https://www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=os4_tablet&referrer=/stat/os4.php#page=181" target="_blank">from page 181 of OpenIntro</a>  that the 95% Confidence Interval for a proportion is given by $$\hat{p} \pm 1.96*SE$$ where $SE = \textrm{Standard Error} = \sqrt\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$. The standard error in CIs is estimated by replacing $p$ with its estimate $\hat{p}$.

Here $n$ is the sample size, 4344 in the `yrbss` data, and the critical value z equals 1.96 for the standard 95% confidence interval.

We can use R as a calculator with `*` being the multiplying operator, `/` being the dividing operator and `sqrt()` being the square root operator.

### Exercise 3 {-}

Construct a confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of non-helmet wearing students (in the general population) who have texted while driving each day for the past 30 days.

`r hide("Hint")`
First calculate a point estimate `p` for the proportion of non-helmet wearing students (in the general population) who have texted while driving each day (look at the output from Exercise 2 for the relevant numbers). The upper and lower bounds can then be calculated as `p + 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)` and `p - 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)`.
`r unhide()`

```{r ex3_solution, webex.hide="Solution", echo=TRUE}
p <- 332/(332+4012)

n <- 332+4012

upper.bound <- p + 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)

lower.bound <- p - 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)

lower.bound

upper.bound
```

```{r MCQ2}
opts_Q2 <- sample(c("We are 90% confident the true proportion of non-helmet wearing  students that texted while driving in all 30 of the previous 30 days is somewhere between 0.069 and 0.084.",
                    "We are 95% confident the true proportion of non-helmet wearing  students that texted while driving in all 30 of the previous 30 days is exactly 0.076, since this is inside the confidence interval.",
                    answer = "We are 95% confident the true proportion of non-helmet wearing  students that texted while driving in all 30 of the previous 30 days is somewhere between 0.069 and 0.084.",
                    "The proportion we  calculated in outside of the interval calculated here, therefore we cannot make any valid interpretations."))
```

### Margin of Error

Recall that the margin of error is half the width of a confidence interval.

Referring back to the previous question, the margin of error is simply

$$ME = z*SE = z \sqrt\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$$ and for a standard 95% CI, $$= 1.96 \sqrt\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$$
```{r margin_error}
moe <- 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
```

<br>

### Exercise 4 {-}

What is the **margin of error** for the estimate of the proportion of non-helmet wearers that have texted while driving each day for the past 30 days based on this survey?  *(to 3 decimal places)*

`r fitb(round(moe, 3))`

```{r, webex.hide="Hint", echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#calculate the margin of error in R using the code

1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)
```

<br>

### Exercise 5 {-}

Using the same method as seen above, repeat the process of constructing a confidence interval for the proportion of students who never wore a bike helmet and

a) Had less than 5 hours sleep,

b) Strength trained every day,

instead of "texted while driving every day of the past 30 days". You should construct two confidence intervals, one for a) and one for b).

You will need to answer the problem in two steps. Firstly, construct a new "yes" or "no" variable, by adapting some code above and considering which variable to change and which category of that variable to change also i.e. what the `==` part equals. Secondly, you will need to construct a confidence interval in the same way as above, by working out your new $p$ and $n$ values using the same methods as before.

`r hide("Hint")`
We have already created the dataset `no_helmet` and want to mutate it to add a new variable which indicates whether a student had less than 5 hours sleep (the number of hours slept is shown by the `school_night_hours_sleep` variable). Then, count the number of "yes"'s in this new variable and use this to calculate an estimate of the proportion `p`.
`r unhide()`

```{r ex5a_solution, webex.hide="Solution (a)", echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
no_helmet <- no_helmet %>%
  mutate(less5_hours_sleep = ifelse(school_night_hours_sleep == "<5", "yes", "no"))

no_helmet %>%
  group_by(less5_hours_sleep) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

p <- 322/(322+4022)

n <- 322+4022

upper.bound <- p + 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)

lower.bound <- p - 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)

lower.bound

upper.bound
```

<br>

`r hide("Hint")`
Within `mutate`, change the `ifelse()` statement to `ifelse(physically_active_7d==7, "yes", "no")` to create a new variable in `no_helmet` that takes the value "yes" if a student has strength trained every day for the past 7 days, and "no" otherwise.
`r unhide()`

```{r ex5b_solution, webex.hide="Solution (b)", echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
no_helmet <- no_helmet %>%
  mutate(train_every_day = ifelse(physically_active_7d==7,"yes","no"))

no_helmet %>%
  group_by(train_every_day) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

p <- 1330/(1330+3014)

n <- 1330+3014

upper.bound <- p + 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)

lower.bound <- p - 1.96*sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)

lower.bound

upper.bound
```

```{r MCQ3}
opts_Q3 <- sample(c(answer = "The proportion of non helmet wearing strength trainers is probably much greater than the proportion of non-helmet wearing people with less than 5 hours sleep, since the CI is far above.",
                    "The proportion of non-helmet wearing strength trainers probably equals the proportion of non-helmet wearing students that gets less than 5 hours sleep.",
                    "We can make no comparisons between the two groups whatsoever at this stage of the analysis.",
                    "The CI for the proportion of non-helmet wearing strength trainers seems far wider than the CI for the proportion of non-helmet wearing students with less than 5 hours sleep."))
```

<br>

**How could you compare the two CI for proportions calculated above?**
`r longmcq(opts_Q3)`

`r hide("Hint")`
Look at where the first proportion's CI ends compared to where the second proportion's CI begins.
