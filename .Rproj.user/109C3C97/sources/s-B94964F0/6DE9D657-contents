# Group Tasks {-}

In August of 2012, news outlets ranging from the Washington Post to the Huffington Post ran a story about the rise of atheism in America. The source for the story was a poll that asked people, “Irrespective of whether you attend a place of worship or not, would you say you are a religious person, not a religious person or a convinced atheist?” This type of question, which asks people to classify themselves in one way or another, is common in polling and generates categorical data.

Load the `atheism` data set into your workspace by typing the following code in an Rscript file in your local Rstudio. Feel free to explore the data before completing the following tasks.

```{r atheism, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}

download.file("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/atheism.RData", destfile = "atheism.RData")
load("atheism.RData")
str(atheism)
```

**How many countries are included with the `atheism` data set?** *(Give your answer as a whole number)*
`r fitb(57)`

### Task 1 {-}

Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Spanish people identify as "atheist" in 2005. You will first need to filter the `atheism` data set by nationality being "Spain", and then by the year 2005.


### Task 2 {-}

Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Spanish people identify as "atheist" in 2012 using the same method as before.

```{r Task2}
opts_Task2 <- sample(c("The two confidence intervals overlap, therefore there is evidence of Spain seeing a change in it's atheism index",
                    "The two confidence intervals do not overlap, therefore there is no evidence of Spain seeing a change in it's atheism index",
                    "The two confidence intervals do not overlap, therefore there is evidence of Spain seeing a change in it's atheism index
",
                    answer = "The two confidence intervals overlap, therefore there is no evidence of Spain seeing a change in it's atheism index"))
```

**Is there convincing evidence that Spain has seen a change in its atheism index between 2005 and 2012?**

`r longmcq(opts_Task2)`

### Task 3 {-}

Repeat Tasks 1 and 2 to calculate two 95% confidence intervals for the proportion of Americans who identify as "atheist" in 2005 and in 2012.


```{r Task3}
opts_Task3 <- sample(c("The two confidence intervals overlap, therefore there is evidence of the USA seeing a change in it's atheism index",
                    "The two confidence intervals do not overlap, therefore there is no evidence of the USA seeing a change in it's atheism index",
                    answer = "The two confidence intervals do not overlap, therefore there is evidence of the USA seeing a change in it's atheism index
",
                    "The two confidence intervals overlap, therefore there is no evidence of the USA seeing a change in it's atheism index"))
```

**Is there convincing evidence that the USA has seen a change in its atheism index between 2005 and 2012?**

`r longmcq(opts_Task3)`

### Task 4 {-}

**If in reality there has been no change in the atheism index in *any* of the countries, in how many of the countries would you expect to detect a change (at a significance level of 0.05) simply by chance?** *(to the nearest whole number)*
`r fitb(3)`

`r hide("Hint")`
We need to take the probability of a Type 1 error (rejecting the null hypothesis when $H_0$ is actually true) and times it by 57 (the number of countries within `atheism`). The probability of a Type 1 error is simply the significance level alpha, in this case, 0.05.
`r unhide()`

### Task 5 {-}

Suppose you’re hired by the local government to estimate the proportion of residents that attend a religious service on a weekly basis. According to the guidelines, the estimate must have a margin of error no greater than 1% with 95% confidence. You have no idea what to expect for $p$, so assume $p=0.5$. Use `R` as a calculator to determine how many people would you have to sample to ensure that you are within the guidelines?

**Note** You don't need to use the `atheism` data set to answer this question.
